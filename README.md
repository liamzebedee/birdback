birdback â€” simple single-user Ubuntu backup app
===============================================

birdback is a simple backup application that is currently in development for Ubuntu. It will be a graphical interface for backing up automatically the user's documents and configuration (located in /etc and /home/user) to external hard drives. The files can then be browsed in the same way you would any other documents on the hard drive.
